# CP Fair RecSys
The re-ranking method for a fair recommendation w.r.t both users and items dimension.

# Dataset Prepration
- **ratings_data.txt**: `user-item interactions (raw file)` (by download, from Cornac or another resource)
- **[DatasetName]_data.txt**: This file is a `k-core` file that the users and items ids are mapped to a new range of indecies.
- 

## Model
To run them model you need to run the `fair_model` notebook. However, due to the anonymity, we remove some Github accounts that we load the datasets from there and this may cause the notebook will not be run properly. We will fix them when the paper got accepted.
